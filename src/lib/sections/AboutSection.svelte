			Hey there, I'm Jonathan!

		<br />

		<p class="text-lg indent-8 leading-tight text-[#233938] subpixel-antialiased sm:text-lg">
			From tinkering with MySpace customizations to diving deep into the world of computer science,
			my journey has been anything but ordinary. Who would've thought the kid who once dreamt of
			stethoscopes would end up falling head over heels for code?
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="indent-8 text-[#233938] text-lg leading-tight subpixel-antialiased sm:text-lg">
			I proudly sport a degree from Oregon State University in Computer Science. But you know what?
			The classroom was just the start. Post-graduation, I've been soaking up everything tech, from
			Dockers to Kubernetes, system architecture, and beyond. Now, Iâ€™m on the lookout to team up
			with like-minded tech enthusiasts. Ready to innovate, learn, and make some digital magic.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="indent-8 text-[#233938] text-lg leading-tight subpixel-antialiased sm:text-lg">
			My toolkit includes Full Stack development, Backend Development, and getting the hang of
			DevOps. Outside the screen, youâ€™ll find me cycling, capturing moments on film, nurturing my
			plants, or having the best time with my two canine companions.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="indent-8 text-[#233938] text-lg leading-tight subpixel-antialiased">
			Life's all about experiences, and Iâ€™m here for all of them, whether coding up a storm or
			hitting the open road! Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
