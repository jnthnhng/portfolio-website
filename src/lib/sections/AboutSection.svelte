			From tinkering with MySpace customizations (hope Iâ€™m not giving away my age here ðŸ˜‰) to diving
			deep into the world of computer science, my journey has been anything but ordinary. Who
			would've thought the kid who once dreamt of stethoscopes would end up falling head over heels
			for code?

			I proudly sport a degree from Oregon State University in Computer Science. But you know what?
			The classroom was just the start. Post-graduation, I've been soaking up everything tech, from
			Dockers to Kubernetes, system architecture, and beyond. Now, Iâ€™m on the lookout to team up
			with like-minded tech enthusiasts. Ready to innovate, learn, and make some digital magic.

			My toolkit? Full Stack development, Backend Development, and getting the hang of DevOps.
			Outside the screen, youâ€™ll find me cycling, capturing moments on film, nurturing my plants, or
			having the best time with my two canine companions.

		<p class="indent-8 text-[#233938] text-s font-serif leading-tight subpixel-antialiased sm:text-lg">
			Life's all about experiences, and Iâ€™m here for all of them, whether coding up a storm or
			hitting the open road! Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
